 * essentially the same as a class expect members are public by default
 * whereas members are private by default in classes
 *
 * general guidelines
 *
 * struct
 * use struct for passive objects with public access
 * do not declare methods in struct
 *
 * class
 * use class for active objects with private access
 * implement getters/setters as needed
 * implement member methods as needed
