static library cc commands:

create .h file includes function prototypes and necessary headers
do not forget to write include guards
create .c file includes function implementations
cc -c main.c -o lib.o
generates .o file for lib
ar rcs <name_the_lib>.a lib.o
generates lib.a file
ar -t lib.a
to see object files contained in static library


for the driver program
cc -I <path directory of lib> -c main.c main.o
cc -o main main.o <lib>.a


linking at compile time

interface expressed in a header file
implementation expressed in a .c file

copies functions to the executable file

creates larger binary files
more time consuming to fix bugs

runs faster
