library types:

  static libraries:
    uses static linking (compile-time, becomes part of the application)
    each process gets its own copy of the code and data
    known as an archive

  shared objects:
    dynamically linked at run time
    shared objects are not included into the executable component but are tied to the execution
    code shared, data is specific to each process



  there is also the concept of a dynamically loaded/unloaded shared object library that is linked during
  execution using the dynamically linking loader system functions
