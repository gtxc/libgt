dynamic library (shared object) cc commands:

  create .h file includes function prototypes and necessary headers
  do not forget to write include guards
  create .c file includes function implementations

  cc -g -fPIC(position independent code) lib.c -shared -o lib.so

  after implementing driver program
  cc -I <path of the lib> -c main.c -o main.o
  cc -o main main.o -L <path of the li> -l <name of the lib without extension>

  before run the program, export path
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<absolute path of the lib>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH



  used in runtime, does not require the code to be copied

  libraries are loaded into memory by programs when they start

  much smaller executable size

  trades off more efficient use of the disk and a quicker linking phase
  for a small runtime penalty

  provides better I/O and swap space utilization and is sparing of physical memory,
  improving overall system throughput

  use ldd to list all of the shared object for a given binary/executable
  ldd <name_of_executable>


procedure to create shared object:

  foo.h
  #ifndef foo_h__
  #define foo_h__

  extern void foo(void);

  #endif  // foo_h__


  foo.c
  #include <stdio.h>

  void foo(void)
  {
    puts("Hello, I am a shared library");
  }



  main.c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include "foo.h"

  int main(void)
  {
    puts("This is a shared library test...");
    foo();
    return 0;
  }

  gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic foo.c

  gcc -shared -o libfoo.so foo.o

  gcc -Wall -o test main.c -lfoo
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lfoo
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


  gcc -L/home/username/foo -Wall -o test main.c -lfoo

  ./test
  # ./test: error while loading shared libraries: libfoo.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/foo:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ./test
  # ./test: error while loading shared libraries: libfoo.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/foo:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ./test
  This is a shared library test...
  Hello, I am a shared library
