enums:
  first declare
    enum primay_color {red, yellow, blue};
    and use it
    enum primary_color colors1, colors2;
    colors1 and colors2 can take one of the colors in primary_color
    color1 = red; // color1 is actually equal to 0
    color2 = blue; // color2 is actually equal to 2
    color2 = 12; // error incompatible types when assigning to type 'enum primary_color'
