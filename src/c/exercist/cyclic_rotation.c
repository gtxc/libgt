 *
 * An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted
 * right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the
 * rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index
 * and 6 is moved to the first place).
 *
 * The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
 *
 * Assume that the following declarations are given:
 *
 * struct Results {
 *   int * A;
 *   int N; // Length of the array
 * };
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * struct Results solution(int A[], int N, int K);
 *
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.
 *
 * For example, given
 *
 *  A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
 *  K = 3
 *
 * the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]. Three rotations were made:
 *
 *  [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] -> [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]
 *  [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] -> [7, 6, 3, 8, 9]
 *  [7, 6, 3, 8, 9] -> [9, 7, 6, 3, 8]
 *
 *  For another example, given
 *
 *  A = [0, 0, 0]
 *  K = 1
 *
 *  the function should return [0, 0, 0]
 *
 *  Given
 *
 *  A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 *  K = 4
 *
 * the function should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
 *
 * Assume that:
 * N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
 * In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
